# Natural Language Processing

NLP is considered its own branch of computer science, focused on computers’ ability to process and even interact with natural human speech. Machine learning and deep learning are used on massive amounts of data to obtain the rules and understanding of nuance in human speech. Everyone who has used Alexa or Google Assistant or other voice command systems knows that they are always improving - but they aren’t perfect. Verbal interactions can be incredibly hard to decipher. Sarcasm, for instance, requires understanding not just words and grammar but tone as well, and regional accents and ways of saying things have to be taken into account, not to mention coverage for all the major languages.
