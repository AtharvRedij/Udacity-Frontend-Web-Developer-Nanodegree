                    Perhaps there are only a few people in the world who have not heard about the Taj Mahal, the famous symbol of love. It is an ivory-white mausoleum built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal after her demise. The Taj Mahal today is the resting place of both Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. The tombs are the centerpiece of the 17-hectare complex. The Taj Mahal was probably completely built by 1653. The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site is today admired by the millions of visitors who visit the site. It is not only one of the 7 wonders of India but also the world.
